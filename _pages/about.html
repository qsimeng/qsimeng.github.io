My research centers on computational imaging, an interdisciplinary field that integrates methods from computer vision, computer graphics, image processing, inverse problems, optics, and artificial intelligence (AI). It involves co-designing hardware and software for solving complex imaging challenges.</p> <p>Contact me if you are seeking help within my research area or are interested in being a collaborator.</p> </body></html>

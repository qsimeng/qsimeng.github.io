<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I earned my Ph.D. degree under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wolfgang Heidrich</a> in Dec 2023. My research focuses on computational imaging, an interdisciplinary field that integrates methods from computer vision, computer graphics, image processing, inverse problems, optics, and deep learning. It involves co-designing hardware and software for solving complex imaging problems.</p> <p>I am always seeking enthusiastic PhD students, Masterâ€™s students, and visiting scholars who are motivated to work on Computational Imaging, Computer Vision, Computer Graphics or related fields. Please send me your CV to join my group or contact me if you need assistance within my research area or are interested in collaborating.</p> </body></html>

I'm an incoming Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at [Swansea University, UK](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/). 

I earned my Ph.D. degree at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/) under the supervision of Prof. [Wolfgang Heidrich](https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/). My research centers on computational imaging, an interdisciplinary field that integrates methods from computer vision, computer graphics, image processing, inverse problems, optics, and artificial intelligence (AI). It involves co-designing hardware and software for solving complex imaging challenges.

Contact me if you are seeking help within my research area or are interested in being a collaborator.

I recently joined [Swansea University](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/) in the UK as a [Lecturer in Computational Imaging](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/simeng.qiu/) in May 2024. I obtained two bachelor's degrees in Communication Engineering from [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin_Institute_of_Technology) in China and in Electronic and Electrical Engineering from the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/) in the UK. After that, I joined [Professor Wolfgang Heidrich's](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IQSbom0AAAAJ&hl=en) [Computational Imaging Group](https://vccimaging.org/) at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/) and received my PhD degree in December 2023. My research focuses on computational imaging, an interdisciplinary field that integrates methods from computer vision, computer graphics, image processing, inverse problems, optics, and deep learning. It involves co-designing hardware and software for solving complex imaging problems.

I am always seeking enthusiastic PhD students, Master's students, and visiting scholars who are motivated to work on Computational Imaging, Computer Vision, Computer Graphics or related fields. Please send me your CV to join my group or contact me if you need assistance within my research area or are interested in collaborating.

I am an incoming Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at [Swansea University's](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/) [Visual Computing Group](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/compsci/research-and-impact/visual-interactive-computing/), UK. I earned my Ph.D. degree at [KAUST's](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/) Computational Imaging Lab under the supervision of [Prof. Wolfgang Heidrich](https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/) in Oct. 2023.

My research centers on computational imaging, an interdisciplinary field that integrates methods from computer vision, computer graphics, image processing, inverse problems, and artificial intelligence. My particular focus is on addressing hardware and software co-design challenges within this domain. 

Contact me if you are seeking help within my research area or are interested in being a collaborator.

I am an incoming Lecturer (assistant professor) at Swansea University, UK. My research focuses on computational imaging, which is an interdisciplinary field that combines computer vision, computer graphics, image processing, invers problems, and artificial intelligence, with a specific emphasis on hardware and software co-design problems.

I earned my PhD title at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/)'s Computational Imaging Lab under the mentorship of [Prof. Wolfgang Heidrich](https://vccimaging.org/People/heidriw/).

Contact me if you are seeking help within my research area or are interested in being a collaborator.

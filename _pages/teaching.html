However, data in itself cannot inform or inspire. We need to ¿do science¿ with the data to extract knowledge and actionable insights. In this module, we will explore scientific methods and processes that make data so valuable to us and society and gain an insight into the world of practical data science and its challenges. We will also cover the ethical issues relating to data.</p> </body></html>
